## Description
Dragon slay is about a Mother Dragon trying to avoid Obstacles in her way in order to save her Baby Dragon from a tower within a given time. In addition she has the option of using 2 fireballs available to her when needed. The player wins the game when the Mother Dragon finally reaches the top of the tower where her baby has been locked up. Game Over is when the time runs out or there is a collision between Mother Dragon and any obstacle.

- One Dragon Obstacle positioned just infront of Baby Dragon (Move left and right within given width)
